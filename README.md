Update: The website has been closed due to hosting costs

## Description

* In Codenames two teams compete by each having a Spymaster give one word clues which can point to multiple words on the board. 
* The other players on the team attempt to guess their team's words while avoiding the words of the other team.
* In this project we demonstrate that a computer can successfully play the role of a good Spymaster.
